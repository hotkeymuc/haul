# HAUL
HotKey's Amphibious Universal Language

This is a puzzle I have set up for myself: Can I write a program that translates itself into other languages? Nothing new, nothing special. Every programmer should have tried this at least once. Well, this is my approach at that.

So I tried. And it worked. And it was fun.

So I did it again. And it was even more fun.

So I did it a third time. And now I really like it. :-)

This is in no way intended for any productive use. It's food for thought. An elaborate toy. Art and fart.
Have fun with it and don't hurt your brain.

# Versions
[HAUL1](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul/tree/master/haul1) was the first attempt. It is written in PHP. I will not say more...

[HAUL2](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul/tree/master/haul2) was the second attempt written in Python. It works, but still requires "boot strapping"

[HAUL3](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul/tree/master/haul3) is the current version: It uses Python as the source language and supports external build chains for 8-bit machines, as well as smart phones and micro controllers.
