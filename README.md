# HAUL
HotKey's Amphibious Universal Language

This is a puzzle I have set up for myself: Can I write a program that translates itself into other languages?

This is nothing new, nothing special. Every programmer should have tried this at least once. (See: transpilers, [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)), [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), etc.) Well, this is my own approach at that.

## History and Versions
* [HAUL1](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul1) was the first attempt. It was written in PHP. But it proved the point.

This is in no way intended for any productive use. It's food for thought. An elaborate toy. Art and fart. A strange loop.
Have fun with it and don't hurt your brain.

# Versions
* [HAUL1](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul1) was the first attempt. It is written in PHP. But it proved the point.

* [HAUL2](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul/tree/master/haul2) was the second attempt written in Python. It works, but still requires "boot strapping"

* [HAUL3](https://github.com/hotkeymuc/haul/tree/master/haul3) is the current version: It uses Python as the source language and supports external build chains for 8-bit machines, as well as smart phones and micro controllers.
