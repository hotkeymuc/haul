Compile/link against these files to get V-Tech Genius LEADER support.

This lib directory resembles a part of the Z88DK.
You can either copy the vtech-specific files to your Z88DK installation
-OR-
use environment variables to force zcc to only use the files here for compilation (should be sufficient for basic stuff).
